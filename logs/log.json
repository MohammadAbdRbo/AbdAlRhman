However, you can easily do it by going to the YouTube website (www.youtube.com) or using a search engine like Google and typing in the name or link of the video you want to watch. Just click on the video thumbnail to start playing it. If you're looking for a specific video tutorial or recommendation, let me know and I can help you find it."}
